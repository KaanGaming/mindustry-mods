For example, `2.3` means that the version is the third build made with algorithm version 2. Every build has different texts.\n## Regenerating bundles\nIf you want to, you can regenerate the bundles to have different texts.\n### You need:\n- Python 3\n- [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify/blob/master/README.md#installation)\n- A terminal\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Open the terminal and navigate to the root of the mod directory\n2. Put the source bundles you want to use to the directory `Mindustry/core/assets/bundles`\n3. Type `python3 randomiser.py`\n4. Wait. It might take some time.\n5. You should have the newly generated random bundles ready!\n\n\n(I made this guide pretty quickly so sorry if there are any mistakes.)\n", "version": "3.5", "wiki": null, "date": "2020-03-30 20:11:38", "header": ""}, {"name": "Opore Mod", "name_markup": "Opore Mod", "link": "https://github.com/xamionex/Opore-Mod", "desc": "Adds multiple vaults, drills, duos, spectres, walls, forges, extractors, conveyors, liquids, mech units, mech pads.", "desc_markup": "Adds multiple vaults, drills, duos, spectres, walls, forges, extractors, conveyors, liquids, mech units, mech pads.
